x = 100
print (x) # This will print the value of x

y = x + 50.5

# Type your code here in line 7

# In python 2.7 the code will work with and without parenthesis
# print y

# but in Python 3, parenthesis is essential
# print (y)
# We will be printing in parenthesis for the rest of the course, however, print statements will also work without parenthesis
